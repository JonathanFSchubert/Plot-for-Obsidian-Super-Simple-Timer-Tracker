# Plot-for-Obsidian-Super-Simple-Timer-Tracker
Makes different plots with the data that comes from the Super Simple Timer Tracker community plugin from Obsidian. Specifically made for study time.

To use copy the data from the Plugin with the buttom "Copy as CSV" and paste this in a file with the name "studytime.csv".
Put this file and the python file in the same folder.
Install the dependencies. Usually it is enough to pip install --user seaborn, as matplotlib will then get installed as well.
